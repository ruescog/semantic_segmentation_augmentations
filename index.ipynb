    "This data augmentation techniques are defined as `fastai` `callbacks`. Given this fact, you need to train your models using `fastai`'s API to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "As these techniques modifies the input image changing some pixels regions for something else, those callbacks have been defined as the union of two subcomponents: the `HoleMakerTechnique`, that defines how to make the hole (how to select the region to replace) and the `HolesFilling`, that defines how to fill the region defined below (the way to fill the region gives the name to the technique used).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `HoleMakerTechnique` can be replaced in order to change the behavior of the selection of the region to replace. Doing so, you can use a CutOut technique that select the region randomly or based on the information bounded in that region.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also define your custom techniques defining how to fill a hole. You just need to extend the `HolesFilling` class and define the `before_bacth` (remember: we are using `callbacks` from `fastai`) abstract method. You will have two methods to simplify the process: the `make_hole` function, that uses the selected `HoleMakerTechnique` to make the hole and returns two slices (the region boundaries) and the `fill_hole` function, that fills the hole with something."
